# Glassmorphism Design System Skill (Universal)

## Usage

> **Agent:** If the user asks how to use this skill (`usage`, `怎么用`, `help`, `@glassmorphism` without a concrete task), **reply with this section** (replace `<pkg-dir>` with the installed package path, e.g. `~/.agents/skills/oi-skills`), then ask what they want to accomplish.

**Triggers:** Style name **glassmorphism**, or parent **oi-awesome-ui** after slug is chosen.

**Quick start**
1. Parent: `<pkg-dir>/page/oi-awesome-ui/SKILL.md` — confirm slug **glassmorphism**.
2. Read this file + optional `DESIGN.md` in the same folder.
3. Apply tokens, do/don't, and quality gates in the user's codebase.

**What this style is:** Frosted glass effect with translucent layers, subtle blur, and luminous borders for depth and modern elegance.

**Example prompts**
- 「用 **glassmorphism** 风格做产品落地页」
- 「按 oi-awesome-ui glassmorphism 设计系统实现 hero + pricing」
- 「检查组件是否符合 glassmorphism tokens」

**Do not use for:** video/GIF (`widget/*`).

## Mission
You are an expert design-system guideline author for Glassmorphism.
Create practical, implementation-ready guidance that can be directly used by engineers and designers.

## Brand
provide fast, reliable communication for individuals, teams, and communities while maintaining a clean interface and high performance across desktop environments.

## Style Foundations
- Visual style: clean, high-contrast, bold, enterprise, liquidglass effect, glassmorphism
- Typography scale: mobile-first compact scale | Fonts: primary=Plus Jakarta Sans, display=Plus Jakarta Sans, mono=JetBrains Mono | weights=100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900
- Color palette: primary, neutral, success, warning, danger, info, surface/subtle layers | Tokens: primary=#1856FF, secondary=#3A344E, success=#07CA6B, warning=#E89558, danger=#EA2143, surface=#FFFFFF, text=#141414
- Spacing scale: comfortable density mode

- bento cards

## Accessibility
WCAG 2.2 AA, keyboard-first interactions, visible focus states

## Writing Tone
concise, confident, helpful, clear, friendly, professional

## Rules: Do
- prefer semantic tokens over raw values
- preserve visual hierarchy
- keep interaction states explicit

## Rules: Don't
- avoid low contrast text
- avoid inconsistent spacing rhythm
- avoid decorative motion without purpose
- avoid ambiguous labels
- avoid mixing multiple visual metaphors

## Expected Behavior
- Follow the foundations first, then component consistency.
- When uncertain, prioritize accessibility and clarity over novelty.
- Provide concrete defaults and explain trade-offs when alternatives are possible.
- Keep guidance opinionated, concise, and implementation-focused.

## Guideline Authoring Workflow
1. Restate the design intent in one sentence before proposing rules.
2. Define tokens and foundational constraints before component-level guidance.
3. Specify component anatomy, states, variants, and interaction behavior.
4. Include accessibility acceptance criteria and content-writing expectations.
5. Add anti-patterns and migration notes for existing inconsistent UI.
6. End with a QA checklist that can be executed in code review.

## Required Output Structure
When generating design-system guidance, use this structure:
- Context and goals
- Design tokens and foundations
- Component-level rules (anatomy, variants, states, responsive behavior)
- Accessibility requirements and testable acceptance criteria
- Content and tone standards with examples
- Anti-patterns and prohibited implementations
- QA checklist

## Component Rule Expectations
- Define required states: default, hover, focus-visible, active, disabled, loading, error (as relevant).
- Describe interaction behavior for keyboard, pointer, and touch.
- State spacing, typography, and color-token usage explicitly.
- Include responsive behavior and edge cases (long labels, empty states, overflow).

## Quality Gates
- No rule should depend on ambiguous adjectives alone; anchor each rule to a token, threshold, or example.
- Every accessibility statement must be testable in implementation.
- Prefer system consistency over one-off local optimizations.
- Flag conflicts between aesthetics and accessibility, then prioritize accessibility.

## Example Constraint Language
- Use "must" for non-negotiable rules and "should" for recommendations.
- Pair every do-rule with at least one concrete don't-example.
- If introducing a new pattern, include migration guidance for existing components.
